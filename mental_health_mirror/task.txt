Mental Health Mirror using AI & Biofeedback

Real-time mental health dashboard using biometric inputs (like heart rate, facial emotion recognition, speech tone analysis) combined with AI to provide a visual and interactive representation of a userâ€™s emotional and mental state.

Facial Emotion Detection: Use computer vision to analyze facial expressions.

Voice Sentiment Analysis: Analyze tone and pitch during conversations.

Smartwatch/Band Integration: Pull heart rate variability, stress levels, and sleep data. (Solely optional eta jodi api pawa jai serokom)

Mood Visualization: Generate a real-time mood "aura" or landscape (e.g., stormy = anxious, sunshine = calm).

AI Suggestions: Give mindfulness exercises, playlist suggestions, or breathing techniques based on detected mood.

Privacy-focused design: All data remains local.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React Native or Flutter (mobile), WebGL (for dynamic visualizations)

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI), TensorFlow or PyTorch for emotion models

APIs: Google Fit / Apple Health / OpenCV / Azure Emotion API

Devices: Optional smartwatch, webcam, microphone

i have this plan to implement either on web or in tkinter dashboard
totally zero cost
and divide it into two parts where
1. all software components like face detection and analysis using cams and other ml logic
2. other sensors that may be implemented after the first one

i gonna use, python, vs code, ryzen 7 5700G procesor, windows system
need a plan to implement quickly


okay i gonna build a tkinter dashboard for my project it will detect faces in realtime as i gave in statement
and others will remain same
but first build the part one logics then i will create the gui

first prptotype ipynb cells
